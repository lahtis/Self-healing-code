# Self‑Healing Localization Layer (SHLL)

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Self‑Healing Localization Layer** — a lightweight, dependency‑free localization system for Python applications.

SHLL eliminates missing translations by automatically:

- creating missing language files  
- adding missing keys  
- copying base templates  
- keeping all languages synchronized  

This documentation covers installation, concepts, guides, API reference, examples, and the project roadmap.
