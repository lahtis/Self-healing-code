# Self‑Healing Localization Layer (SHLL)

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Self‑Healing Localization Layer**, a lightweight and dependency‑free localization system for Python applications.

SHLL is designed to eliminate common localization problems by automatically:

- creating missing language files
- adding missing translation keys
- synchronizing all languages with a shared base template
- preventing translation drift as your project grows

This makes SHLL ideal for games, tools, and applications where clarity, maintainability, and long‑term consistency matter.

## Key Features

- **Self‑healing architecture**  
  Automatically detects missing or outdated keys and updates language templates without overwriting existing translations.

- **Minimalistic and predictable design**  
  Built with a Nordic mindset: clean structure, no unnecessary dependencies, and long‑term maintainability.

- **Template‑driven workflow**  
  Ensures all languages follow the same schema, reducing errors and manual work.

- **Developer‑friendly API**  
  Simple interfaces for loading, retrieving, and managing localized strings.
